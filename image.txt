Type scale

The Once UI typography system is designed to cater to the requirements of the majority of product
interfaces. Although in rare instances, it may seem restrictive, the average product requires nothing
beyond the provided scale.

The scale can be expressed using either REMs or pixels, however, the utilization of REMs as the
fundamental unit offers greater flexibility and the ability to make precise adjustments across various
devices.

Additionally, utilizing REMs as the base unit enables dynamic scaling of your user interface, based on
the dimensions of the screen. This provides a more optimized experience for users, as text size and
spacing can be adjusted automatically to suit the particular device.

Scale accommodates a three-tier hierarchy, featuring two distinct weights, which can be expanded to
an eight-tier hierarchy through the incorporation of Heading Types.
